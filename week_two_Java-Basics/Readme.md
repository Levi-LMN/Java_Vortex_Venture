#The anatomy of the Java program
## 1.1. The main method
The main method is the entry point of a Java program. It is the method that is called when the program is executed by the Java interpreter. The main method must be declared as follows:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // code goes here
}
```
The main method is declared as public, which means that it can be accessed from anywhere. It is also declared as static, which means that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. The main method returns void, which means that it does not return any value. Finally, the main method takes a single parameter of type String[], which is an array of strings. This parameter is used to pass command-line arguments to the program.

## 1.2. The System class
The System class is a final class that provides access to the system resources. It contains several static fields and methods that can be used to interact with the system. For example, the System.out field is a PrintStream object that can be used to print output to the standard output stream. The System.err field is a PrintStream object that can be used to print output to the standard error stream. The System.in field is an InputStream object that can be used to read input from the standard input stream. The System.currentTimeMillis() method returns the current time in milliseconds. The System.exit(int status) method terminates the program with the specified status code.

## 1.3. The String class
The String class represents a sequence of characters. It is a final class, which means that it cannot be extended. It is also an immutable class, which means that its state cannot be modified after it has been created. The String class provides several methods for manipulating strings. For example, the length() method returns the length of the string. The charAt(int index) method returns the character at the specified index. The substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) method returns a substring of the string. The equals(Object obj) method returns true if the string is equal to the specified object. The equalsIgnoreCase(String str) method returns true if the string is equal to the specified string, ignoring case considerations. The compareTo(String str) method compares the string to the specified string lexicographically. The compareToIgnoreCase(String str) method compares the string to the specified string lexicographically, ignoring case considerations. The startsWith(String prefix) method returns true if the string starts with the specified prefix. The endsWith(String suffix) method returns true if the string ends with the specified suffix. The indexOf(String str) method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified string. The lastIndexOf(String str) method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified string. The contains(CharSequence s) method returns true if the string contains the specified character sequence. The replace(char oldChar, char newChar) method returns a new string resulting from replacing all occurrences of the specified old character with the specified new character. The replace(CharSequence target, CharSequence replacement) method returns a new string resulting from replacing all occurrences of the specified target character sequence with the specified replacement character sequence. The toLowerCase() method returns a new string resulting from converting all characters of the string to lower case. The toUpperCase() method returns a new string resulting from converting all characters of the string to upper case. The trim() method returns a new string resulting from removing all leading and trailing white spaces from the string. The split(String regex) method returns an array of strings resulting from splitting the string around matches of the specified regular expression. The join(CharSequence delimiter, CharSequence... elements) method returns a new string resulting from concatenating the specified elements using the specified delimiter. The valueOf(Object obj) method returns the string representation of the specified object. The format(String format, Object... args) method returns a formatted string using the specified format string and arguments. The format(Locale l, String format, Object... args) method returns a formatted
string using the specified locale, format string, and arguments.

## 1.4. The StringBuilder class
The StringBuilder class represents a mutable sequence of characters. It is a final class, which means that it cannot be extended. The StringBuilder class provides several methods for manipulating strings. For example, the append(String str) method appends the specified string to the end of the string builder. The insert(int offset, String str) method inserts the specified string at the specified offset. The delete(int start, int end) method deletes the characters from the specified start index to the specified end index. The deleteCharAt(int index) method deletes the character at the specified index. The reverse() method reverses the characters of the string builder. The toString() method returns the string representation of the string builder.

## 1.5. The Math class
The Math class is a final class that provides several static methods for performing mathematical operations. For example, the abs(int a) method returns the absolute value of the specified integer. The abs(long a) method returns the absolute value of the specified long. The abs(float a) method returns the absolute value of the specified float. The abs(double a) method returns the absolute value of the specified double. The min(int a, int b) method returns the smaller of the two specified integers. The min(long a, long b) method returns the smaller of the two specified longs. The min(float a, float b) method returns the smaller of the two specified floats. The min(double a, double b) method returns the smaller of the two specified doubles. The max(int a, int b) method returns the larger of the two specified integers. The max(long a, long b) method returns the larger of the two specified longs. The max(float a, float b) method returns the larger of the two specified floats. The max(double a, double b) method returns the larger of the two specified doubles. The pow(double a, double b) method returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the second argument. The sqrt(double a) method returns the square root of the specified double. The cbrt(double a) method returns the cube root of the specified double. The hypot(double x, double y) method returns sqrt(x^2 + y^2) without intermediate overflow or underflow. The sin(double a) method returns the sine of the specified double. The cos(double a) method returns the cosine of the specified double. The tan(double a) method returns the tangent of the specified double. The asin(double a) method returns the arcsine of the specified double. The acos(double a) method returns the arccosine of the specified double. The atan(double a) method returns the arctangent of the specified double. The atan2(double y, double x) method returns the angle theta from the conversion of rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, theta). The toDegrees(double angrad) method converts an angle measured in radians to an approximately equivalent angle measured in degrees. The toRadians(double angdeg) method converts an angle measured in degrees to an approximately equivalent angle measured in radians. The exp(double a) method returns Euler's number e raised to the power of the specified double

## 1.6. The Random class
The Random class is a final class that provides several methods for generating random numbers. For example, the nextInt() method returns a pseudorandom integer between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive). The nextInt(int bound) method returns a pseudorandom integer between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive). The nextLong() method returns a pseudorandom long. The nextFloat() method returns a pseudorandom float between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive). The nextDouble() method returns a pseudorandom double between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive). The nextBoolean() method returns a pseudorandom boolean. The nextGaussian() method returns a pseudorandom double with a mean of 0.0 and a standard deviation of 1.0.
