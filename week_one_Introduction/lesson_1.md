#Introduction to Java

Java is a programming language and a platform.  
• It is a high level, robust, secured and object-oriented programming language.  
• It is also a Platform: A platform is any hardware or software environment in which a program
runs. Remember Operating Systems are softwares that runs on hardware platforms, But Os also
acts as platforms on which applications runs.  
◦ Since Java has its own runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called platform.  

Introduction to Java: A Robust and Versatile Programming Language
Java stands out as one of the most widely used and versatile programming languages in the software development landscape. Renowned for its high-level nature, robustness, security features, and object-oriented paradigm, Java has become a cornerstone in the creation of a myriad of applications, from enterprise-level systems to mobile applications.

# Key Characteristics of Java
High-Level Language:

Java is considered a high-level programming language, meaning that it abstracts many low-level details, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly syntax. This characteristic simplifies the coding process and allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing hardware intricacies.
Robustness:
  
One of the distinctive features of Java is its emphasis on robustness. The language includes built-in mechanisms for handling errors and exceptional situations, which contributes to the creation of reliable and fault-tolerant applications. The strict compile-time checking and runtime checking mechanisms in Java enhance the overall robustness of the code.
Security:

Security is paramount in today's interconnected world, and Java addresses this concern with its robust security features. The language incorporates multiple layers of security, including a sandbox environment for applets, which are small applications that run within a web browser. This ensures that malicious code is contained and does not compromise the host system.
Object-Oriented Paradigm:

Java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, where software is structured around objects that encapsulate data and behavior. This approach promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, making it easier for developers to design and manage complex systems.
Java as a Platform
Apart from being a programming language, Java is also recognized as a platform. A platform, in the context of software development, refers to the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. Unlike some other languages that are tied to specific operating systems, Java's platform independence is a key advantage.

# Java Runtime Environment (JRE):

Java's platform independence is facilitated by its own runtime environment, known as the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE provides the necessary runtime libraries and components for executing Java applications. This decouples Java programs from the underlying hardware and operating system, allowing them to run on any device with a compatible JRE.
Application Programming Interface (API):

Java's platform is further enriched by its extensive Application Programming Interface (API). The API provides a set of pre-built classes and libraries that simplify common programming tasks. This extensive collection of reusable components empowers developers to build applications efficiently, reducing development time and promoting code standardization.
